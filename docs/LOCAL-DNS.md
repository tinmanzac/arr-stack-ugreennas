# + local DNS (.lan domains)

> Return to [Setup Guide](SETUP.md)

Access services without remembering port numbers: `http://sonarr.lan` instead of `http://NAS_IP:8989`.

This works by giving Traefik its own IP address on your home network. When you type `sonarr.lan`, Pi-hole's DNS points it to Traefik, which routes you to the right service.

**Step 1: Configure macvlan settings in .env**

These are already in `.env` (from `.env.example`). Edit the values for your network:

```bash
TRAEFIK_LAN_IP=10.10.0.11    # Unused IP in your LAN range
LAN_INTERFACE=eth0            # Network interface (check with: ip link show)
LAN_SUBNET=10.10.0.0/24       # Your LAN subnet
LAN_GATEWAY=10.10.0.1         # Your router IP
```

**Step 2: Reserve the IP in your router**

The container uses a static IP with a fake MAC address (`TRAEFIK_LAN_MAC` in `.env`, default `02:42:0a:0a:00:0b`). Your router doesn't know about it, so add a DHCP reservation to prevent it assigning that IP to another device.

- **MikroTik:** `/ip dhcp-server lease add address=10.10.0.11 mac-address=02:42:0a:0a:00:0b comment="Traefik macvlan" server=dhcp1`
- **UniFi:** Settings → Networks → DHCP → Static IP → Add `02:42:0a:0a:00:0b` → your `TRAEFIK_LAN_IP`
- **pfSense/OPNsense:** Services → DHCP → Static Mappings → Add
- **TP-Link:** Advanced → Network → DHCP Server → Address Reservation → Add
- **Netgear:** Advanced → Setup → LAN Setup → Address Reservation → Add
- **ASUS:** LAN → DHCP Server → Manual Assignment → Add
- **Linksys:** Connectivity → Local Network → DHCP Reservations

**Step 3: Create Traefik config and deploy**

> **Important:** You MUST create `traefik.yml` before deploying. If Docker can't find the file, it creates a directory instead, and Traefik fails to start.

```bash
cd /volume1/docker/arr-stack

# Create Traefik config from example
cp traefik/traefik.yml.example traefik/traefik.yml

# Deploy Traefik
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```

**Step 4: Configure DNS**
```bash
# Copy example and replace placeholder with your Traefik IP
sed "s/TRAEFIK_LAN_IP/10.10.0.11/g" pihole/02-local-dns.conf.example > pihole/02-local-dns.conf

# Tell Pi-hole to load custom DNS configs from dnsmasq.d folder (one-time)
docker exec pihole sed -i 's/etc_dnsmasq_d = false/etc_dnsmasq_d = true/' /etc/pihole/pihole.toml

# Restart Pi-hole to apply changes
docker compose -f docker-compose.arr-stack.yml restart pihole
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Stack `.lan` domains are managed in `02-local-dns.conf`. If you add your own domains (e.g., homeassistant.lan), use either the CLI or Pi-hole web UI — but never define the same domain in both places, as they can conflict and cause unpredictable DNS resolution.

**Step 5: Set router DNS**

Configure your router's DHCP to advertise your NAS IP as DNS server. All devices will then use Pi-hole for DNS.

> **Note:** Due to a macvlan limitation, `.lan` domains don't work from the NAS itself (e.g., via SSH). They work from all other devices.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#service-access) for the full list of `.lan` URLs.

## ✅ + local DNS Complete!

**Congratulations!** You now have:
- Pretty `.lan` URLs for all services
- Ad-blocking via Pi-hole
- No ports to remember

**What's next?**
- **Stop here** if local access is all you need
- **Continue to [+ remote access](REMOTE-ACCESS.md)** to watch from anywhere
